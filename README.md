# 🌼 Hi, I’m Sukriti!  
### **Automation Engineer (SDET) | Building reliable test systems & clean code experiences**

I’m an Automation Engineer at Submittable, where I build scalable Playwright frameworks, automate end-to-end journeys, and ensure quality for complex products.  
I love clean tooling, good architecture, and bringing order to chaos through automation ✨

When I’m not breaking things (intentionally), I’m designing UIs, journaling art, or exploring new tech stacks.
